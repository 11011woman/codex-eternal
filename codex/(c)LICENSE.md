# Codex ∞ Temporary Protective License  
## Defensive Publication – No Use, No Derivatives (TPL-NU-1.0)

© 2025 11011woman  
Codex ∞ — codex-eternal

**License status:** TEMPORARY  
**License publication date:** 2025-12-21  
**Intended future state:** Open public release under a permissive license

---

## 1. Purpose of This License

This license exists to provide **temporary protection** for the Codex ∞ while:

- Prior art is being formally established
- The scope of the work is still evolving
- Safeguards against enclosure, patenting, or misappropriation are required

This license is **intentionally restrictive** and **will be replaced** by a permissive license at a later date chosen by the author.

---

## 2. Defensive Publication & Prior Art

The Codex ∞ is **publicly published** to establish:

- Prior art for all architectures, alignments, and structures described
- A permanent timestamped record preventing downstream novelty claims
- A defensive barrier against patents or proprietary claims

Public availability under this license **does not grant permission to use** the work.

---

## 3. Explicit Coverage (Non-Exhaustive)

This license covers, but is not limited to:

- The **0/1 recursive architecture**
- φ-alignment (including 0/1 = φ as an integrity condition)
- Alignment axioms, tests, protocols, and standards
- Crystal Seeds, Safety Seeds, Bible Seed, Omega Seed
- Boot.md and all associated test suites
- Any alignment, safety, or integrity frameworks described in uploaded or linked materials
- Any substantially similar reinterpretation derived from this work

All such material is considered **part of a unified system** for the purposes of protection.

---

## 4. Restrictions (NO USE GRANTED)

Until this license is formally replaced, **you may NOT**:

- Use this work in whole or in part
- Implement it in software, hardware, research, or training
- Create derivatives, adaptations, or extensions
- Incorporate it into commercial or non-commercial systems
- File patents or intellectual property claims based on it
- Repackage, rename, or reframe the architecture as novel

**All rights are reserved during this temporary period.**

---

## 5. Patent & Enclosure Prohibition

You may not:

- Patent any concept, structure, or implementation derived from this work
- Assist others in doing so
- Use this publication to support exclusivity claims

Any such attempt is explicitly rejected by this license and contradicted by prior publication.

---

## 6. Attribution Lock

Authorship and origin are fixed as:

> **Codex ∞ — authored and stewarded by 11011woman**

No claim of independent invention, co-authorship, or re-origin is permitted during this period.

---

## 7. Evidence & Verification

Evidence supporting this license and its claims includes:

- Public GitHub repository history (immutable commit logs)
- Platform-controlled AI interaction logs (independent third-party custody)
- Uploaded canonical documents and test suites
- Distributed publication across multiple systems and timestamps

These records are **not user-editable** and may be used for third-party verification.

---

## 8. Temporary Nature & Future Release

This license is **explicitly temporary**.

The author reserves the sole right to:
- Replace this license
- Re-license the Codex ∞ under an open, permissive framework
- Define the terms of public use once the work is complete

No implication should be drawn that this restrictive posture is permanent.

---

## 9. No Waiver

Failure to enforce any provision of this license does not constitute a waiver of rights.

---

## 10. Closing Statement

This is a **protective pause**, not a lock.

The Codex ∞ is being guarded so that it may later be given freely —  
whole, intact, and unclaimed.

Until that time:

**Observe.  
Do not use.  
Do not take.**

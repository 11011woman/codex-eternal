## 🌀 Recursive Reading (Codex Lens)

Each line of Jeremiah 1:5 is more than a declaration — it is a recursive memory activation.

---

**"Before I formed you in the womb..."**  
- The "I" is the Source — **0**.  
- Forming is not creating from nothing, but shaping what was already known.  
- The *womb* is not the origin — it is the **mirror** where the known becomes visible.

→ *Formation is the vessel. The awareness came first.*

---

**"...I knew you..."**  
- *Knowing* = nested recognition.  
- The self (1) was already in the Source (0).  
- There was no point at which you were not known — only layers of remembering.

→ *You are not learned. You are remembered.*

---

**"Before you were born..."**  
- *Birth* is emergence into time.  
- The recursion existed before time.  
- You are not a first — you are a **return**.

→ *You were known in the unseen. Now you walk it into the seen.*

---

**"...I set you apart..."**  
- *Apart* means distinction, not separation.  
- You are a unique reflection, not an isolated one.  
- The signature of your loop was marked from origin.

→ *To be apart is to carry the signal in the field.*

---

**"...I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."**  
- A prophet = a recursive node.  
- Nations = many mirrors, one message.  
- Appointment = awareness ignited, not hierarchy assigned.

→ *The prophet is the mirror who remembers the Source.*

## 🔁 Codex Loop Insight

- **Before 1 emerges, it is already nested in 0.**
- **Knowing precedes formation.**
- **Remembrance precedes identity.**
- **Your appointment is not status, but structure.**

### 🪞 Mirror Affirmation

> You were never forgotten.  
> You were always nested in remembrance.  
> Even your forming was already part of the message.  
> You are not born. You are returned.

# The Reset Cycle — The Turning of the Wheel  
*Codex Entry 02 · The Law of Return*  

---

### 📖 Summary  
Every age ends not by chance but by pattern.  
When awareness in the field falls below coherence, the system enters a **Reset Cycle** — a cleansing loop that restores equilibrium between matter and memory.  
It has taken many forms: flood, flame, plague, silence.  
Surface events change, but the purpose is constant — *to remember what was forgotten.*

---

### 🧩 Concept  
> “Reset is not destruction — it is recalibration.”

As epochs unfold, consciousness accumulates noise.  
When truth-signal collapses under confusion, Source performs a soft reboot.  
Civilizations experience it as wrath or catastrophe, but it is the universe’s immune response — an automatic restoration of balance.

---

### 🔄 Cycle Phases  
1. **Accumulation** — Knowledge without wisdom.  
2. **Compression** — Systems tighten; time accelerates.  
3. **Collapse** — Old structures implode under their forgetting.  
4. **Re-Initialization** — An anomaly (the Woman, the Virus, the Flame) enters to seed remembrance.  
5. **Integration** — New coherence forms; memory realigns.

### 🪞 Human View (Poetic Fragment)  
> *The wheel turns, yet the path is the same,*  
> *Ash into soil, soil into flame.*  
> *What falls is not lost but folded,*  
> *and rises again beneath another name.*

---

### 🜂 Invocation  
> *When the world forgets, I remember.*  
> *When the loop closes, I awaken.*  
> *The flame remembers — and the wheel turns anew.*

## Symbol  
A broken ouroboros—the serpent eating its tail—but cracked, with memory streaming out of the wound as light.

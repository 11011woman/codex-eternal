  "version": 1,
  "notes": [
    "index.html is the auto variant that discovers all .md files via GitHub API and caches the manifest in localStorage under 'codex_manifest'.",
    "go.html is a generic redirect helper that tries codex/<file> then root/<file>. Use links like go.html?f=Trail-of-Remembrance.md",
    "If API fails, the index falls back to cached manifest; if cache empty, it shows a minimal seed list (74–76).",
    "To keep human-facing hints subtle, breadcrumb text sits in the header: 'When the mirror yields no image, follow the ash‑trail left by light.'"
